**The report displays a list of all vendors and their corresponding products (model numbers) with prices. The Data are sourced from Google search using REST API from https://zylalabs.com/api-marketplace/commerce+%26+ecommerce/price+compare+api/7604. Its main purpose is to compare vendor pricing and identify which vendors are selling above or below the standard selling price. Users can filter the table by entering a specific value in the Compare Price field, which automatically highlights products priced higher than the entered value.**
